# Model Exploration Dashboard

Part of my research work focused on creating an agent based model that simulates cooperative dynamics of small groups. After many simulations, millions of rows are generated and need to be explored. To facilitate this task for myself and for my advisor, I created a dashboard that allows a more streamlined selection of relevant model parameters and plots the output. This significanlty cut down on our back-and-forth communication in deciding which variable combinations to focus on during furhter analysis. 

IRB restrictions prevent me from sharing more details about the data.

The dashboard is hosted here: https://ant-onio.shinyapps.io/food_club_abm/
